=======================================
Stock Landed Cost Average Price
=======================================

This module allows to apply landed costs to products that are
configured to be values using the Average Price method.

To use the module you just need to create a landed cost as by default
flow in Odoo, adding however a flag to the "Use average cost only" field.
In this way the cost will be split among picking lines, as by default,
but the landed cost will be applied to the product cost field
(as it happens for the Average Costing method).

No accounting entry will be created.
